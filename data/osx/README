The CMPL (Coliop Mathematical Programming Language) Package:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CMPL (Coliop/Coin Mathematical Programming Language) is a mathematical programming 
language and a system for modelling, solving and analysing linear programming (LP)
problems and mixed integer programming (MIP) problems.

The CMPL syntax is similar in formulation to the original mathematical model but
also includes syntactic elements from modern programming languages. CMPL is 
intended to combine the clarity of mathematical models with the flexibility of 
programming languages. CMPL contains the COIN-OR OSSolverService including the 
COIN-OR solvers. Since it is also possible to transform the mathematical 
problem into MPS, Free-MPS or OSiL files, alternative solvers can be used.

CMPL is an open source project licensed under  GPL. It is written in C++ and 
is available for most of the relevant operating systems.  CMPL is a COIN-OR 
project initiated by the Technical University of Applied Sciences Wildau 
and the Institute for Operations Research and Business Management at the 
Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (both of Germany).

REQUIREMENTS 
CMPL uses the COIN-OS binaries to solve LPs and MIPs. 
Therefore it is necessary to install COIN-OS beside CMPL or to to use an
existing COIN-OS installation.

See the INSTALL for the necessary steps.
