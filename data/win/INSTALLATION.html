	<h2>INSTALL CMPL</h2>

	<ol><li>Download OSSOlverService <br><br>
	
	CMPL uses the OSSolverService binary for solving LPs and MIPs. 
	Therefore it is necessary to install OSSolverService beside CMPL.
	<br><br>
	You can download the OSSolverService binary by using the following link:<br>
	
	<a href="http://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/OS/OSSolverService/OSSolverService-2.3.5-win32-msvc9.exe.zip">
	http://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/OS/OSSolverService/OSSolverService-2.3.5-win32-msvc9.exe.zip</a><br><br>

	</li><li> Extract the downloaded file to the folder OSSolverService\ <br>
	Right-hand mouse click in the Windows Explorer and choose "Extract All .."<br> <br>

	</li><li>Copy the folder OSSolverService to C:\Program Files\OSSolverService<br> <br>

	</li><li>Copy the folder Cmpl to C:\Program Files\Cmpl<br></li></ol>


Please ensure that the folder c:\Program Files\Cmpl is included in the
environment variable PATH. 

<h2>START CMPL</h2>


The CMPL command line tool can be used in two modes. Using the solver mode, an LP or MIP can be formulated, solved and analysed. 
In this mode, the OSSolverservice is invoked. <br>
In the model mode it is possible to transform the mathematical problem into MPS, Free-MPS or OSiL files 
that can be used by certain alternative LP or MIP solvers.

<h2>DEINSTALL CMPL</h2>

To deinstall the CMPL package you only have to delete the folders
c:\Program Files\Cmpl and
c:\Program Files\OSSolverService</span>
