INSTALLING CMPL ON YOUR COMPUTER 
**********************************************************************************

These instructions are for UNIX-like systems (including Linux and MSys/MinGW) only.

To build CMPL you have to install gcc, Qt4  and optional flex and bison.
Test passed on
	Linux 					gcc, Qt4, flex, bison 
	Mac OSX  				gcc, Qt4, flex, bison 
	Windows (v7, XP) 		using MSys/MinGW	gcc, Qt4

Please download Qt4 using the link http://qt-project.org/ and install it. 

For Windows it is strongly recommended to use the MSys/MinWG environment.
Please download the "Automated MinGW Installer" using the following link:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/

**********************************************************************************
A) Download and Unpack the distribution 										
**********************************************************************************

You can obtain the source code for the CMPL package in two ways:

1)	SVN 
	Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   	(recommended).  
    	
   	Checking out the source using a subversion client.
    	e.g. the latest stable version -> svn co  https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Cmpl/stable/X.Y CMPL
    	e.g. the latest realease -> svn co  https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Cmpl/releases/X.Y.Z CMPL 


	
2)	Download the latest release version from the CMPL source code download page
	http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Cmpl/

	It is an archive file 'cmpl-X.Y.Z.tar.gz', where 'X.Y.Z' is the version number.
	
	
**********************************************************************************
B) Prepare COIN-OS and GLPK as part of the CMPL package
**********************************************************************************
CMPL uses the COIN-OS OSSolverService or GLPK for solving LPs and MIPs. 
Therefore it makes sense to build and install a customized version of COIN-OS 
and the latest version of GLPK beside CMPL. 

1) 	OS X and Linux
	You can obtain COIN-OS and GLPK by executing the following command: 
		./cmplMake getExternals
	
	
2) 	Windows
    	There are two scripts in the <cmplHome>/Cmpl/data/ folder to build COIN-OS and/or GLPK
		./build-GLPK-for-cmpl
		./build-COIN-OS-for-cmpl
    	
    	Before you execute these scripts you have to download the COIN-OS and the GLPK packages.
		
		http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/OS/OS-<osRelease>.zip
       	http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/glpk-<glpkRelease>.tar.gz

		Unzip the archive files into the following folders:
		
		<cmplHome>/Cmpl/data/COIN-OS-<osRelease>
		<cmplHome>/Cmpl/data/glpk-<glpkRelease>
		
		Please check in the scripts the parameters glpkRelease and osRelease in the scripts:
		./build-GLPK-for-cmpl
		./build-COIN-OS-for-cmpl
		
		To build COIN-OS and GLPK please execute both scripts.
		
		Both scripts build the binaries and install it in the folder
		<cmplHome>/Cmpl/Thirdparty/GLPK and <cmplHome>/Cmpl/Thirdparty/COIN-OS
	   
	   
	   
	   	
**********************************************************************************
C) Prepare Coliop as a part of the CMPL package
**********************************************************************************
The CMPL distribution contains Coliop which is an (simple) IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 
for CMPL. 

1) 	OS X and Linux
	You can obtain Coliop (together with COIN-OS and GLPK) by executing the following command: 
		./cmplMake getExternals
	
2) 	Windows
    	You have to download the Coliop package:
    	http://cmpl.th-wildau.de/download/coliop/coliop-<coliopRelease>.zip
    	
    	Unzip the archive file into the following folders:
		<cmplHome>/Cmpl/data/Coliop
		
		
**********************************************************************************
D) Prepare the Python binary for pyCMPL and CMPLServer
**********************************************************************************
It is necessary to install a Python 2.7 to execute pyCMPL and CMPLServer.

1) 	OS X and Linux
	Only check whether Python 2.7 is installed. If not download and install it.
	
2) 	Windows
		We recommend to use PyPy:
			Please download PyPy using the following link
    			 http://pypy.org/download.html#default-with-a-jit-compiler 
    		unzip it in 	
    			 <cmplHome>\pyCmpl\Thirdparty\
    		and rename the folder 
				<cmplHome>\pyCmpl\Thirdparty\pypy-<version>
			into 
				<cmplHome>\pyCmpl\Thirdparty\pypy
		
		If you want to use an alternative Python distribution then you have to edit in 
			<cmplHome>\pyCmpl\scripts\Windows\pyCmpl.bat  
    		<cmplHome>\pyCmpl\scripts\Windows\cmplServer.bat 
    		<cmplHome>\pyCmpl\test\test-all 
    	the entry for the environment variable PythonBin
    
	
**********************************************************************************
E) Compiling the package 
**********************************************************************************
You can compile CMPL by typing the command:
       
    ./cmplMake 

It reads the cmpl project file  and performs all necessary jobs.

**********************************************************************************
F) Checking the package
**********************************************************************************
To check the package, i.e. to run some tests included in the package,
you can use the following command:

    ./cmplMake  test
    
**********************************************************************************    
F) Build a distribution package 
**********************************************************************************
To create a specific distribution package for your operating system you should 
type the following command:

    ./cmplMake package

This creates a CMPL distribution package command in the folder:
    [cmplFolder]/Package/[ linux | osx | win ]

**********************************************************************************
G) Installing the CMPL package
**********************************************************************************
To install the CMPL package you should type the following
command:

    ./cmplMake install

This command will install the CMPL distribution package in the follwing folders:
    
    Apple OSX
        program folder -> /Applications/Cmpl
        script to execute cmpl -> /usr/bin/cmpl

    Linux
        program folder -> /usr/share/Cmpl
        script to execute cmpl -> /usr/bin/cmpl

Installing under Windows

	To install the CMPL package you only have to copy the folder

	[cmplFolder]/Package/win/Cmpl
	
	to c:\program files\Cmpl
		
	Please ensure that this folder is included in the environment variable PATH.
	
Since Coliop is written in Java you have to download and install the java runtime enviroment:
http://java.com/download/index.jsp
  

**********************************************************************************
H) Cleaning the package
**********************************************************************************
After installing you can remove the object files
from the source directory by typing

    ./cmplMake clean
