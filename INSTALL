INSTALLING CMPL ON YOUR COMPUTER 
**********************************************************************************

These instructions are for UNIX-like systems (including Linux, Cygwin
and MSys/MinGW) only.

To build CMPL you have to install gcc, Qt4  and optional flex and bison.
Test passed on
	Linux 								gcc, Qt4, flex, bison 
	Mac OSX  							gcc, Qt4, flex, bison 
	Windows (v7, XP) using MSys/MinGW	gcc, Qt4

Please download Qt4 using the link http://qt.nokia.com/

For Windows it is strongly recommended to use the MSys/MinWG environment.
Please download the "Automated MinGW Installer" using the following link:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/

**********************************************************************************
A) Download and Unpack the distribution 										
**********************************************************************************

You can obtain the source code for the CMPL package in two ways:

1)	The CMPL package is distributed in the form of a packed archive.

	It is a archive file 'cmpl-X.Y.Z.tar.gz', where
	'X.Y.Z' is the version number.
	
	In order to prepare the distribution for installation you should:
	
	1. Download the archive file from http://www.coliop.org/download/
	2. Copy the CMPL distribution file to a working directory.
	3. Unpack the distribution file 
	
2)	SVN 
	Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   	(recommended).  
    	
   	Checking out the source using a subversion client.

    e.g. the latest stable version -> svn co  https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Cmpl/stable/X.Y CMPL
    e.g. the latest realease -> svn co  https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Cmpl/releases/X.Y.Z CMPL 


	
**********************************************************************************
B) Prepare COIN-OS as part of the CMPL package
**********************************************************************************
CMPL uses the COIN-OS binaries for solving LPs and MIPs. 
Therefore it is necessary to install COIN-OS beside CMPL or to to use an
existing COIN-OS installation.

1) 	Using an existing COIN-OS installation
	To connect CMPL with the COIN-OS binaries you have to change the path of
	the OSSolverService binary in the file cmpl.opt.
	
	OSSolverServicePath =  theOSSolverServicePath/
	
2)  Download OSSolverService binary from 
	http://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/OS/OSSolverService/ and
	copy it in the directory of your choice. After this you have to change the
	the path of	the OSSolverService binary in the file cmpl.opt.
	
	OSSolverServicePath =  theOSSolverServicePath/
	
3) 	Build a COIN-OS package

	Download and build the COIN-OS and the GLPK packages
	- 	Linux and Apple OS X
		
		Copy the script data/build-COIN-OS-for-cmpl in a working
		directory and execute it.

    		./build-COIN-OS-for-cmpl
    
		This script downloads, builds and installs COIN-OS in 
		the folder COIN-OS/bin. 
		
		After these steps, you can copy COIN-OS in the directory 
		of your choice.
		
	- 	Windows 
		Before you execute the script build-COIN-OS-for-cmpl you 
		have to download the COIN-OS and the GKLPK packages.
		You can build the COIN-OS package with the following steps:
           	http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/OS/OS-2.3.5.zip
           	http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/glpk-4.45.tar.gz
        
    		Unzip the COIN-OS package into COIN-OS
    		Unzip the GLPK package into COIN-OS/ThirdParty/Glpk/glpk

    		Build the COIN-OS package
        	./build-COIN-OS-for-cmpl
        
		After these steps you can find the binaries in the folder 
		COIN-OS/bin and you can copy the binaries in a directory 
		of your choice.
	
		To connect CMPL with the COIN-OS binaries you have to change the path of
		the OSSolverService binary in the file cmpl.opt.
	
		OSSolverServicePath =  /theOSSolverServicePath/
    
	
**********************************************************************************
C) Compiling the package 
**********************************************************************************
You can compile CMPL by typing the command:
       
    ./cmplMake 

It reads the cmpl project file  and performs all necessary jobs.

**********************************************************************************
D) Checking the package
**********************************************************************************
To check the package, i.e. to run some tests included in the package,
you can use the following command:

    ./cmplMake  test
    
**********************************************************************************    
E) Build a distribution package 
**********************************************************************************
To create a specific distribution package for your operating system you should 
type the following command:

    ./cmplMake package

This creates a CMPL distribution package command in the folder:
    [cmplFolder]/Package/[ linux | osx | win ]

**********************************************************************************
F) Installing the CMPL 
**********************************************************************************
To install the CMPL package you should type the following
command:

    ./cmplMake install

This command will install the CMPL distribution package in the follwing folders:
    
    Apple OSX
        program folder -> /Applications/Cmpl
        script to execute cmpl -> /usr/bin/cmpl

    Linux
        program folder -> /usr/share/Cmpl
        script to execute cmpl -> /usr/bin/cmpl

Installing CMPL under Windows

	To install the CMPL package you have to execute the install script

	[cmplFolder]/Package/win/Cmpl/installCmpl.bat
	
	in the administrator mode. (Right-hand mouse click in the Windows Explorer
	on this file and choose Run as Administrator) 

	This command downloads the OSSolverService binary from 
	http://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/OS/OSSolverService/,
	installs it in c:\Program Files\OSSolverService\ and installs the CMPL 
	distribution package in c:\Program Files\Cmpl.
	
	Please ensure that this folder is included in the environment variable PATH.
  

**********************************************************************************
G) Cleaning the package
**********************************************************************************
After installing you can remove the object files
from the source directory by typing

    ./cmplMake clean
