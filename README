The CMPL (Coliop Mathematical Programming Language) Package:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CMPL (Coliop Mathematical Programming Language) is a mathematical programming
language for modelling linear programming (LP) problems or mixed integer
programming (MIP) problems. 


The CMPL syntax is similar to the expression of
the original mathematical model but includes also syntactic elements from of
modern programming languages. CMPL is indented to combine the clarity of
mathematical models with the flexibility of programming languages. CMPL
transforms the mathematical problem in MPS, Free-MPS or OSiL (see
https://projects.coin-or.org/OS or http://www.optimizationservices.org)
files which can be used with certain solvers. Since CMPL contains a direct 
connection to the OSSolverServices it is also possible to use 
CMPL as a command line solver. 

CMPL is also a part of Coliop3 which is an IDE (Integrated Development
Interface) intended to solve LP and MIP problems. 

CMPL is an open source project licensed under GPL. It is written in C++
and is available for all relevant operating systems. CMPL and Coliop3 are
projects of the Technical University of Applied Sciences Wildau and the
Institute for Operations Research and Business Management at the
Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. 

For further information please visit the CMPL/Coliop3 website (www.coliop.org). 

REQUIREMENTS 
CMPL uses the COIN-OS binaries to solve LPs and MIPs. 
Therefore it is necessary to install COIN-OS beside CMPL or to to use an
existing COIN-OS installation.

See the INSTALL for the necessary steps.
