The CMPL (<Coliop|Coin> Mathematical Programming Language) Package:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*********** CMPL ************************* 
CMPL (<Coliop|Coin> Mathematical Programming Language) is a mathematical programming language 
and a system for mathematical programming and optimization of linear optimization problems. 

The CMPL syntax is similar in formulation to the original mathematical model but also 
includes syntactic elements from modern programming languages. CMPL is intended to combine 
the clarity of mathematical models with the flexibility of programming languages. 

CMPL executes the COIN-OR OSSolverService, GLPK, Gurobi, SCIP and CPLEX directly to solve the generated model 
instance. Since it is also possible to transform the mathematical problem into MPS, 
Free-MPS or OSiL files, alternative solvers can be used. 

CMPL is an open source project licensed under GPL. It is written in C++ and is available 
for most of the relevant operating systems (Windows, OS X and Linux). 
CMPL is a COIN-OR project initiated by the Technical University of Applied Sciences Wildau 
and the Institute for Operations Research and Business Management at the Martin Luther 
University Halle-Wittenberg.

*********** Coliop ************************ 
The CMPL distribution contains Coliop which is an (simple) IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 
for CMPL. Coliop is a project of the Technical University of Applied Sciences Wildau and the 
Institute for Operations Research and Business Management at the Martin Luther University.
Coliop is an open source project licensed under GPL. It is written in Java and is as an integral 
part of the CMPL distribution available for most of the relevant operating systems. 

*********** pyCMPLK and CMPLServer ********
Since release 1.8 the CMPL package contains also pyCMPL and CMPLServer
pyCMPL is the CMPL API  for Python and an interactive shell. 
The main idea of this API is 
* to define sets and parameters within the user application, 
* to start and control the solving process and 
* to read the solution(s) into the application if the problem is feasible. 
All variables, objective functions and constraints are defined in CMPL. 
These functionalities can be used with a local CMPL installation or a CMPLServer.

CMPLServer is an XML-RPC-based web service for distributed optimization.
It is reasonable to solve large models remotely on the CMPLServer that is installed on a high performance system.
pyCMPL provides a client API for CMPLServer. CMPL provides three XML-based file formats for the communication 
between a CMPLServer and its clients. (CmplInstance, CmplSolutions, CmplMessages)
